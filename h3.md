# h3 No Strings Attached

## a) Strings: Extracting Data from passtr
The goal of this task was to analyze the ``passtr`` binary to find a hidden password and flag using static analysis.

- First, I downloaded the ``ezbin-challenges.zip`` and navigated to the directory:

- I typed this command on my terminal
```
unzip ezbin-challenges.zip
cd challenges/passtr
```
- I ran the ``pastr`` script as seen below:
 
 ```
./passtr
```

- I was prompted for a password. Providing incorrect input resulted in a "Sorry, no bonus" message, confirming the binary validates input against a hardcoded value.

- So then I utilized the ``strings`` command, which scans the binary for sequences of printable characters.

- On my termial I typed:

```
  strings passtr
```

- There were many lines of charachters but luckily the password was very clear, as it shows in the screenshot below:

- The password appeared to be: sala-hakkeri-321
- So I ran the previous script again ``./paastr``, and entered the password. Here was the successful result as shown below!
